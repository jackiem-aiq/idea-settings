# idea-settings

These are default IntelliJ IDEA settings that you can use as a baseline to be consistent with everyone else. 
See [here](https://actioniq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENG/pages/1833467952/IDEA+IntelliJ#Setup) for instructions
on how to setup your own personal IDEA settings repo.
 
This repo is meant to be *read-only* as you should sync it down once, then sync up to your own personal settings.
